    insights = """

    1. **Job Role and Subscription Rate**:
        - Students and retired individuals are more likely to subscribe to a term deposit.

    2. **Marital Status Influence**:
        - Single clients have a higher subscription rate compared to married or divorced clients.

    3. **Education Level Impact**:
        - Higher education levels, such as high school, university, and personal courses, have higher subscription rates compared to primary education.

    4. **Housing Loan and Personal Loan Factors**:
        - Clients with existing housing loans are more likely to subscribe to term deposits.
        - Clients without existing personal loans are more likely to subscribe to term deposits.

    5. **Contact Method Effectiveness**:
        - Contacting clients via cell phones yields higher subscription rates.

    6. **Time-Related Factors**:
        - **Month**: Subscription rates are higher during September, October, December, and March.

    7. **Effect of Previous Campaign Outcomes**:
        - Customers who had a successful interaction in the previous campaign are more likely to subscribe to the current one.

    8. **Economic Indicators' Influence**:
        - Economic context variables, such as the employment variation rate (`emp.var.rate`), consumer price index (`cons.price.idx`), number of employees (`nr.employed`), and Euribor 3-month rate (`euribor3m`), have a negative impact on the subscription rate.
        - On the other hand, the consumer confidence index (`cons.conf.idx`) has a positive impact on the subscription rate.

    9. **Duration of Last Contact**:
        - The duration of the last contact is a strong indicator of the outcome. Longer conversation durations have a higher chance of subscription.

    10. **Campaign Performance Metrics**:
        - More calls during the current campaign are more likely to result in an unsuccessful deposit.
        - On the other hand, more calls before the current campaign are more likely to result in a successful deposit.
